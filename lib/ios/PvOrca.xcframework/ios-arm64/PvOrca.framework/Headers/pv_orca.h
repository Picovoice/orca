/**
 * Forward declaration for Orca text-to-speech engine. Orca converts text to spoken audio without network latency.
 * It has two modes of operation.
 *     1) Single synthesis: converts a given text to audio. Function `pv_orca_synthesize()` returns the raw audio data,
 *        function `pv_orca_synthesize_to_file()` saves the audio to a file.
 *     2) Streaming synthesis: Converts a stream of text to a stream of audio. An OrcaStream object can be opened with
 *        `pv_orca_stream_open()` and text chunks can be added with `pv_orca_stream_synthesize()`.
 *        The incoming text is buffered internally and only when enough context is available will an audio chunk
 *        be generated. When the text stream has concluded, the caller needs to use `pv_orca_stream_flush()`
 *        to generate the audio for the remaining buffer that has yet to be synthesized. The stream can be closed
 *        with `pv_orca_stream_close()`. Single synthesis functions cannot be called while a stream is open.
